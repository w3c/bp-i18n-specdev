      <p>This document provides a checklist of internationalization-related considerations when developing a specification. Most checklist items point to detailed supporting information in other documents. Where such information does not yet exist, it can be given a temporary home in this document. The dynamic page <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/developing-specs-dynamic">Internationalization Techniques: Developing specifications</a> is automatically generated from this document. <strong>The current version is still an early draft, and it is expected that the information will change regularly as new content is added and existing content is modified in the light of experience and discussion.</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Developers of specifications need advice  to ensure that what they produce will work for communities around the globe.</p>
      <p>The Internationalization (i18n) WG tries to assist working groups  by reviewing specifications and engaging in discussion. Often, however, such interventions come later in the process than would be ideal, or mean that the i18n WG has to repeat the same information for each working group it interacts with.</p>
      <p>It would be better if specification developers could access a checklist of best practices, which points  to explanations, examples and rationales where developers need it. Developers would then be able to build this knowledge into their work from the earliest stages, and could thereby reduce  rework needed when the i18n WG reviews their specification.</p>
      <p>This document contains the beginnings of a checklist, and points to locations where you can find explanations, examples and rationales for recommendations&nbsp;made.&nbsp; If there is no such other place, that extra information will be added to this document. It is still early days for this document, and it may also be used to develop ideas and organize them.</p>
      <p>The guidelines in this document are not intended to be hard and fast requirements. This document will achieve a significant part of its purpose if, where you don't understand the guidelines or disagree with them, you contact the Internationalization WG to discuss what should be done.</p>
      <p>You may prefer to use <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/developing-specs?collapse">Internationalization Techniques: Developing specifications</a> most of the time, since it uses JavaScript to  help you more quickly see what's available and drill down to the information you need. (Where needed, it links to this or other documents.) There is also a <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/developing-specs">non-dynamic version</a> of the document available.</p>
<p>If your spec is github based, you can now create a snapshot of the checklist items in markdown. If you add that to a github issue, you can check off items that are ok, and add comments while doing a self-review. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#ghChecklist">Generate the code here</a>.</p>

  <h3>Language basics</h3>
  
  <p class="advisement" id="lang_basics_1"><a class="self" href="#lang_basics_1">&#x200B;</a>It should be possible to associate a language with any piece of natural language text that will be read by a user. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_lang_decl">more</a></p>
  <p class="advisement" id="lang_basics_inline"><a class="self" href="#lang_basics_inline">&#x200B;</a>Where possible, there should  be a way to label natural language changes in inline text. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_lang_decl">more</a></p>
  <p>Text is rendered or processed differently according to the language it is in. For example, screen readers need to be prompted when a language changes, and spell checkers should be language-sensitive. When rendering text a knowledge of language is need in order to apply correct fonts, hyphenation, line-breaking, upper/lower case changes, and other features.</p>
  <p>For example, ideographic characters such as 雪, 刃, 直, 令, 垔 have slight but important differences when used with  Japanese vs Chinese fonts, and it's important not to apply a Chinese font to the Japanese text, and vice versa when it is presented to a user.</p>
  <p class="advisement" id="lang_basics_meta"><a class="self" href="#lang_basics_meta">&#x200B;</a>Consider whether it is useful to express the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_lang_meta">intended linguistic audience</a> of a resource, in addition to specifying the language used for <a href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_text_processing_lang">text processing</a>. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_lang_decl">more</a></p>
   <p>Language information for a given resource can be used with two main objectives in mind: for text-processing, or as a statement of the intended use of the resource. We will explain the difference below.</p>
 
  <section id="sec_text_processing_lang">
    <h4>Text-processing language information</h4>
    <p class="advisement" id="tp_lang_values"><a class="self" href="#tp_lang_values">&#x200B;</a>A language declaration that indicates the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_text_processing_lang">text processing language</a> for a range of text must associate  a single language  value with a specific range of text. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_text_processing_lang">more</a></p>
    <p>When specifying the <dfn>text-processing language</dfn> you are declaring the language in which <strong>a specific range of text is actually written</strong>, so that user agents or applications that manipulate the text, such as voice browsers, spell checkers,  style processors, hyphenators, etc., can apply the appropriate rules to the text in question. So we are, by necessity, talking about associating a <em>single</em> language with a <em>specific</em> range of text.</p>
    <p>It is normal to express a text-processing language as the default language, for processing the resource as a whole, but it may also be necessary to indicate where the language changes within the resource.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_attribute_xml"><a class="self" href="#lang_attribute_xml">&#x200B;</a>Use the HTML <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> and XML <code class="kw" translate="no">xml:lang</code> language attributes where appropriate to identify the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_text_processing_lang">text processing language</a>, rather than creating a new attribute or mechanism. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#lang_attribute_xml">more</a></p>
    To identify the text-processing language for a range of text, HTML provides the <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> attribute, while XML provides <code class="kw" translate="no">xml:lang</code> which can be used in all XML formats. It's useful to continue using those attributes for relevant markup formats, since authors recognize them, as do HTML and XML processors.
  </section>
  
  <section id="sec_lang_meta">
    <h4>Language metadata about the resource as a whole</h4>
    <p>It may also be useful to describe the language of a resource <strong> as a whole</strong>. This type of language declaration typically indicates the <strong>intended use of the resource</strong>. For example, such metadata may be used for searching, serving the right language version, classification, etc. </p>
    <p>This type of language declaration differs from that of the text-processing declaration in that (a)  the value for such declarations may be more than one  language subtag, and (b) the language value declared doesn't indicate which bits of a multilingual resource are in which language.</p>
     <p class="advisement" id="metadata_lang_values"><a class="self" href="#metadata_lang_values">&#x200B;</a>It should be possible to associate a  metadata-type language declaration (which indicates the intended use of the resource rather than the language of a specific range of text)  with multiple language  values. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_lang_meta">more</a></p>
   <p>The language(s) describing the intended use of a resource do not necessarily include every language used in a document. For example, many documents on the Web contain embedded fragments of content in different languages, whereas the page is clearly aimed at speakers of one particular language. For example, a German city-guide for Beijing may contain useful phrases in Chinese, but it is aimed at a German-speaking audience, not a Chinese one.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, it is also possible to imagine a situation where a document contains the same or parallel content in more than one language. For example, a web page may welcome Canadian readers with French content in the left column, and the same content in English in the right-hand column. Here the document is equally targeted at speakers of both languages, so there are two audience languages. Another use case is a blog or a news page aimed at a multilingual community, where some articles on a page are in one language and some in another. In this case, it may make sense to list more than one  language tag as the value of the language declaration.</p>
<p class="advisement" id="metadata_not_lang"><a class="self" href="#metadata_not_lang">&#x200B;</a>Attributes that express the language of external resources should not use the HTML <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> and XML <code class="kw" translate="no">xml:lang</code> language attributes, but should use a different attribute when they represent metadata (which indicates the intended use of the resource rather than the language of a specific range of text). <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_lang_meta">more</a></p>
<p>Using a different attribute to indicate the language of an external resource allows the attribute to specify more than one language. It also works better if the resource pointed to is not in a single language. </p>
<p>This distinction can be seen in HTML in the separation of the <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">hreflang</code> attributes. The former indicates the language of the text within the HTML page; the latter is metadata indicating the  expected language of a page that is linked to.</p>
<p>For a longer discussion of this see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-when-xmllang">xml:lang in XML document schemas</a>. This article talks specifically about <code class="kw" translate="no">xml:lang</code>, but the concepts are applicable to other situations.</p>

    <h3>Defining language values</h3>
    
      <p class="advisement" id="lang_use_bcp47"><a class="self" href="#lang_use_bcp47">&#x200B;</a>Values for language declarations must use BCP 47. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_lang_values">more</a></p>
    <p>BCP 47 defines a method to combine subtags in order to create a much more powerful notation for language tags than that provided by the old ISO lists, but it is also backwards compatible with the ISO lists.</p>
    <p>For an overview of the key features of BCP 47, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/">Language tags in HTML and XML</a>.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_bcp_not_rfc"><a class="self" href="#lang_bcp_not_rfc">&#x200B;</a>Refer to BCP 47, not to RFC 5646. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_lang_values">more</a></p>
    <p>The link to and name of BCP 47 was created specifically so that there is an unchanging reference to the definition of Tags for the Identification of Languages. RFCs 1766, 3066, 4646 were previous (superseded) versions and 5646 is the current version of BCP 47.</p>
 
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_values_specificity"><a class="self" href="#lang_values_specificity">&#x200B;</a>Be specific about what level of conformance you expect for language tags: BCP 47 defines two levels of conformance, "valid" and "well-formed".</p>

    <p>A <strong>well-formed</strong> BCP 47 language tag follows the syntax defined for a language tag: implementations check that each language tag consists of hyphen-separated subtags; each subtag has a specific length and specific content (letters, digits or specific combinations) depending on the placement in the tag. A <strong>valid</strong> BCP 47 language tag is well-formed but additionally ensures that only subtags that are listed in the IANA Subtag Registry are used. Note that the IANA Subtag Registry is frequently updated with new subtags.</p>    

    <p class="advisement" id="lang_checking_well_formed"><a class="self" href="#lang_checking_well_formed">&#x200B;</a>Specifications may require implementations to check if language tags are "valid", but in most circumstances should only require that the language tags be "well-formed".</p>

    <p>Most specifications are second-order consumers of language metadata &ndash; they are using data already provided in the document format (HTML <span class=kw translate=no>lang</span>, XML <span class=kw translate=no>xml:lang</span>, or the document format's language fields/attributes).</p>

    <p>Generally most specifications are concerned with selecting resources (such as spell checkers, tokenizers, fonts, etc.) or with matching (selecting which string to show, for example) and don't directly care about the content of the language tag. Invalid-but-well-formed tags just don't match anything and usually fallback schemes provide some behavior that is appropriate.</p>

    <p>There might be cases where a specification really wants implementation-level checking for validity. In those cases, the result of a tag failing to be valid has to be specified (should the application die, warn the user, etc.). It's also a problem that the registry is sizeable and changes over time, so each implementation is registry-version dependent. The changes over time are often minor, but real users will encounter interoperability issues if random (out of date) implementations of the specification reject language tags that have become valid at a later date.</p>
 
    <p>In addition, BCP 47 has an extension mechanism which defines add-on subtag sequences. For example, one extension [[RFC6067]] (Unicode Locales, which uses the singleton <span class=kw translate=no>-u</span>), is commonly used for controlling the internationalization features of JavaScript (and has other uses). Validating these additional subtags is likely out of scope for most specifications.</p> 
    
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_values_valid"><a class="self" href="#lang_values_valid">&#x200B;</a>Specifications should require content and content authors to use "valid" language tags.</p>
     
    <p>Normative language regarding language tags might be different between content and implementation requirements. Specification authors need to carefully consider what conformance requirements and tests are needed for their specification and what implementations are required to do. One solution is to normatively require that "valid" language tags be used by content authors but only require implementations to check for "well-formed" language tags.</p> 
    
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_matching_bcp"><a class="self" href="#lang_matching_bcp">&#x200B;</a>Reference BCP47 for language tag matching.</p>
 
 <p>BCP 47 contains one RFC dedicated to the syntax and subtags of language tags, and another dedicated to how to match two or more subtags.  (This topic needs more detail, and may merit being a separate section.)</p>

    <h3>Declaring  language at the resource level</h3>
   <p>Here we are talking about an independent unit of data that contains structured text. Examples may include a whole HTML page, an XML document, a JSON file, a WebVTT script, an annotation, etc.</p>
   <p class="advisement" id="lang_whole_res"><a class="self" href="#lang_whole_res">&#x200B;</a>The specification should indicate how to define the default text-processing language for the resource as a whole. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#lang_whole_res">more</a></p>
    <p>It often saves trouble to identify the language, or at least the default language, of the resource as a whole in one place. For example, in an HTML file, this is done by setting the <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> attribute on the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> element.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_inherit"><a class="self" href="#lang_inherit">&#x200B;</a>Content within the resource should inherit the language of the text-processing declared at the resource level, unless it is specifically overridden.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_tp_meta"><a class="self" href="#lang_tp_meta">&#x200B;</a>Consider whether it is necessary to have separate declarations to indicate the text-processing language versus metadata about the expected use of the resource. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#lang_tp_meta">more</a></p>
    <p>In many cases a resource contains  text in only one language, and in many more cases the language declared as the default language for text-processing is the same as the language that describes the metadata about the resource as a whole. In such cases it makes sense to have a single declaration.</p>
    <p>It becomes problematic, however, to use a single declaration when it refers to more than one language unless there is a way to determine which one language should be used as the text-processing default.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_mixing"><a class="self" href="#lang_mixing">&#x200B;</a>If there is only one language declaration for a resource, and it has more than one language tag as a value, it must be possible to identify the default text-processing language for the resource. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#lang_tp_meta">more</a></p>

  <p>It is important to establish direction for text written or mixed with right-to-left scripts. Characters in these scripts are stored in memory in the order they are typed and pronounced – called the logical order. The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UBA) provides a lot of support for automatically rendering a sequence of characters stored in  logical order so that they are visually ordered as expected. Unfortunately, the UBA alone is not sufficient to correctly render bidirectional text, and additional information has to be provided about the default directional context to apply for a given sequence of characters.</p>
 
 <section id="sec_dir_basic" class="subtopic">
  <h3>Basic requirements</h3>
 <p>The basic requirements are as follows.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="dir_paragraphs"><a class="self" href="#dir_paragraphs">&#x200B;</a>It must be possible to indicate base direction for each individual paragraph-level item of natural language text that will be read by someone. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#dir_paragraphs">more</a></p>
    <p class="advisement" id="dir_inline"><a class="self" href="#dir_inline">&#x200B;</a>It must be possible to indicate base direction changes for embedded runs of inline bidirectional text for all natural language text that will be read by someone. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#dir_inline">more</a></p>
    <p class="advisement" id="dir_reasonable"><a class="self" href="#dir_inline">&#x200B;</a>Annotating right-to-left text must require the minimum amount of effort for people who work natively with right-to-left scripts. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#dir_reasonable">more</a></p>
    <p>Requiring a speaker of Arabic, Divehi, Hebrew, Persian, Urdu, etc. to add markup or control characters to every paragraph or small data item they write is far too much to be manageable. Typically, the format should establish a default direction and require the user to intervene only when exceptions have to be dealt with.</p>
</section>


<section id="sec_dir_background" class="subtopic">
  <h3>Background information</h3>
	<p>In this section we try to set out some key concepts associated with text direction, so that it will be easier to understand the recommendations that follow.</p>
   
    
<section id="sec_dir_defs">
  <h4>Important definitions</h4>
  <p>In order to correctly display text written in a 'right-to-left' script or left-to-right text containing bidirectional elements, it is important to establish the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics#context" class="termref">base direction</a> that will be used to dictate the order in which elements of the text will be displayed.</p>
  <p>If you are not familiar with what the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UBA) does and doesn't do, and why the base direction is so important, read <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>.</p>
  <aside class="example">
    <p>For example, the following annotation will not display correctly unless the application doing the display knows that the base direction needs to be right-to-left.</p>
    <pre>{
  "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
  "id": "http://example.org/anno5",
  "type":"Annotation",
  "body": {
    "type" : "TextualBody",
    "text" : "פעילות הבינאום, W3C",
    "format" : "text/html",
    "language" : "he"
  },
  "target": "http://example.org/photo1"
}
    </pre>
    <p>You would expect the phrase in the <code class="kw" translate="no">text</code> property value to be displayed as</p>
    <p><span dir="rtl">פעילות הבינאום, W3C</span></p>
    <p>however, if there is no indication that the base direction should be right-to-left the following incorrect display will be produced:</p>
    <p>פעילות הבינאום, W3C</p>
  </aside>

  <p>In this section, the word <dfn>paragraph</dfn> indicates a run of text followed by a hard line-break in plain text, but may signify different things in other situations. In CSV it equates to 'cell', so a single line of comma-separated items is actually a set of comma-separated paragraphs.&nbsp; In HTML it equates to the lowest level of block element, which is often a <code class="kw" translate="no">p</code> element, but may be things such as <code class="kw" translate="no">div</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">li</code>, etc., if they only contain text and/or inline elements. In JSON, it often equates to a quoted string value, but if a string value uses markup then paragraphs are associated with block elements, and if the string value is multiple lines of plain text then each line is a paragraph.</p>
  <p>The term <dfn>metadata</dfn> is used here to mean information which could be an annotation or property associated with the data, or could be markup in scenarios that allow that, or could be a higher-level protocol, etc.</p>
</section>


<section id="setting_bd">
<h4>Ways base direction can be set for paragraphs</h4>
<p>There are a number of possible ways of setting the base direction.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The base direction of a paragraph may be set by an application or a user applying metadata to the paragraph.  Typical values for base direction may include <code class="kw" translate="no">ltr</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">rtl</code> or <code class="kw" translate="no">auto</code>.
<ul>
  <li>The metadata may specifically indicate that  heuristics should be used. Then you would expect to consider the actual characters used in order to determine the base direction. (This is what happens if you set <code>dir=auto</code> on an HTML element.)</li>
  <li>The application may expect metadata, but there may be no such information provided.  In this case you would usually expect there to be a default direction specified, and the base direction for a cell would be set to that default.  The default is usually LTR. (This is what happens if you have no <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> attributes in your HTML file.)</li>
  <li>Where a format contains many paragraphs or chunks of information, and the language of text in all those chunks is the same, it is sometimes useful to allow a default base direction to be set for and inherited by all. This is what happens when you set the <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> attribute on the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag in HTML. Another example would be a subtitling file containing many cues, all written in Arabic; it would be best to allow the author to say at the start of the file that the default is RTL for all cue text. There should always be a way to override the direction information for a specific paragraph where needed.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>If the application expects no metadata to be available it should use heuristics to determine the base direction for each paragraph/cell. A typical solution, and one described by UAX	9 <cite>Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm</cite>, is to look for the first-strong character in the paragraph/cell.  (This is likely to apply if you are looking at plain text  that is not expected to be associated with metadata. It only happens with HTML if the direction is set to <code class="kw" translate="no">auto</code>, since HTML specifies a default direction.)
    <ul style="margin-left:0; margin-right:1em;">
  <li>Not all paragraphs using the first-strong method will have the correct base direction applied. In some cases, an Arabic or Hebrew, etc, paragraph may start with strong LTR characters. There must be a way to deal with this.</li>
  <li>Where a syntactic unit contains multiple lines of plain text (for example, a multiline cue text in a subtitling file), the first-strong heuristic needs to be applied to each line separately.</li>
  <li>There may be special rules that involve ignoring some sequence of characters or type of markup at the start of the paragraph before identifying the first strong character.</li>
  <li>In some cases there are no strong characters in a paragraph, and the base direction can be critically important for the data to be understood correctly, eg. telephone numbers or MAC addresses. There needs to be a way to resort to an appropriate default for these cases.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Whether or not  any metadata is specified, if a paragraph contains a string that starts with one of the Unicode bidi control characters  RLI, LRI, FSI, LRE, RLE, LRO, or RLO and ends with PDF/PDI, these characters will determine the base direction for the contained string. These characters, when placed in the content, explicitly override any previously set direction by creating an inline range and assigning a base direction to it.
    <ul style="margin-left:0; margin-right:1em;"><li>The effect of such characters does not extend past paragraph boundaries, but the range ought to be explicitly ended using the PDF/PDI control character, especially if a paragraph end is not easily detectable by the application.)</li>
      <li>Because isolation is needed for bidirectional text to work properly, the Unicode Standard says that the isolating control codes RLI, LRI and FSI should be used rather than LRE or RLE. Unfortunately, those characters are still not widely supported.</li>
      <li>For structural components in markup, above the paragraph level, it is not possible to use the Unicode bidi control characters to define direction for  paragraphs, since these are inline controls only, and the effect is terminated by a paragraph end.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
<p>When capturing text input by a user it is usually necessary to understand the context in which the user was inputting the data to determine the base direction of the input. In HTML, for example, this may be set by the direction inherited from the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag, or by the user pressing keys to set the base direction for a form field. It is then necessary to find some way of storing the information about base direction or associating it with the string when rendered. Typically, in this situation, any direction changes internal to the string being input are handled by the user and will be captured as part of the string.</p>
</section>




<section id="inline_changes">
<h4>Inline changes to base direction</h4>
<p>Embedded ranges of text <em>within</em> a single paragraph may need to have a different base direction. For example, </p>
<p>&quot;The title was '!NOITASILANOITANRETNI'.&quot;</p>
<p>where the span within the single quotes is in Hebrew/Arabic/Divehi, etc., and needs to have a RTL base direction, instead of the LTR base direction of the surrounding paragraph, in order to place the exclamation mark correctly. </p>
<p>If markup is available to the content author, it is likely to be easier and safer to use markup to indicate such inline ranges (see below). In HTML you would usually use an inline element with a <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> attribute to establish the base direction for such runs of text.  If you can't mark up the text, such as in HTML's <code class="kw" translate="no">title</code> element, or any environment that handles only plain text content, you have to resort to Unicode's paired control characters to establish the base direction for such an internal range.</p>
<p>Furthermore, inline ranges where the base direction is changed should be isolated from surrounding text, so that the UBA doesn't produce incorrect results due to interference across boundaries. <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/#uc5">See an&nbsp;example</a> of how this can produce incorrect ordering of things such&nbsp;as text followed by numbers in HTML, or <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/#usecase3">another example</a> of how it can affect lists.</p>
<p>This means that if a content author is using Unicode control codes they should use RLI/LRI...PDI rather than RLE/LRE...PDF.&nbsp; These isolating codes are fairly new, and applications may not yet support them.</p>
</section>




<section id="control_problems">
<h4>Problems with control characters</h4>
<p>Reasons to avoid relying on  control characters to set direction  include the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They are invisible in most editors and are therefore difficult to work with, and can easily lead to orphans and overlapping ranges.  They can be particularly difficult to manage when editing bidirectional inline text because it's hard to position the cursor in the correct place. If you ask someone who writes in a right-to-left script, you are likely to find that they dislike using control codes.</li>
  <li>Users often don't have the necessary characters available on their keyboard, or have difficulty inputting them.</li>
  <li>It is sometimes necessary to choose which to use based on context or the type of the data, and this means that a content author typically needs to select the control codes – specifying control codes in this way for all paragraphs is time-consuming and error-prone.</li>
  <li>Processors that extract parts of the data, add to it, or reuse in combination with other text  may incorrectly handle the control codes.</li>
  <li>Search and comparison algorithms should ignore these characters, but typically don't.</li>
  </ol>
<p>The last two items above may also hold for markup, but implementers often support included markup better than  included control codes.</p>
<p>Don't expect users to add control codes at the start and end of every paragraph. That's far too much work.</p>
</section>


<section id="rlmlrm">
<h4>RLM and LRM</h4>
<p>A word about the Unicode characters <span class="uname">U+200F   RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</span> (RLM) and <span class="uname">U+200E   LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK</span> (LRM) is warranted at this point.</p>
<p>The first point to be clear about is that neither RLM nor LRM establish the base direction for a range of text.&nbsp; They are simply invisible characters with strong directional properties.</p>
<p>This means that you cannot use RLM for example, to make the text W3C appear to the left of the Hebrew text in the following example.</p>
<p>The title is "<span dir="rtl">פעילות הבינאום, W3C</span>".</p>
<p>For this you can only use metadata or the paired control characters.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are detecting base direction using first-strong heuristics then RLM and LRM can be useful for setting the base direction where the text in question begins with something that would otherwise give the wrong result, eg. </p>
<p>"<span dir="rtl">نشاط التدويل</span>" is how you say "i18n Activity" in Arabic.</p>
<p>Here an LRM could be placed at the start of the text, before the strong RTL Arabic characters, to prevent the algorithm from assuming that the text should be right-to-left. (Remember that if metadata is used to set the base direction, that character is ignored, unless the metadata specifically says that first-strong heuristics should be used.)</p>

<h4>Base direction and language</h4>
    <p class="advisement" id="bidi_lang"><a class="self" href="#bidi_lang">&#x200B;</a>Do not assume that direction can be determined from language information. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#bidi_lang">more</a></p>
    <p>The following are all reasons you cannot use language tags to provide information about base direction:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>you can't produce the <code class="kw" translate="no">auto</code> value with language tags.</li>
    <li>some languages are written with both RTL and LTR scripts.</li>
    <li>the only reliable part of the language tag that would indicate the base direction is the script tag, but BCP47 recommends that you suppress the use of the script tag for languages that don't usually need it, such as  Hebrew (<code>suppressscript: Hebr</code>). Languages, such as Persian, that are usually written in a RTL script may be written in transcribed form, and it's not possible to guarantee that the necessary script tag would be present to carry the directional information. In summary, you won't be able to rely on people supplying script tags as part of the language information in order to influence direction.</li>
    <li>the incidence of use of language tags and base direction markers  often don't coincide.</li>
    <li>they are not semantically equivalent.</li>

<p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">auto</code> value allows automatic detection of the base direction for a piece of text. For example, the <code class="kw" translate="no">auto</code> value of <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> in HTML looks for the first strong directional character in the text, but ignores certain items of markup also, to guess the base direction of the text. Note that automatic detection algorithms are far from perfect. First-strong detection is unable to correctly identify text that is really right-to-left, but that begins with a strong LTR character. Algorithms that attempt to judge the base direction based on contents of the text are also problematic. The best scenario is one where the base direction is known and declared.</p>

At the block level, this should be achieved using attributes or metadata, and should not rely on Unicode control characters. </p>
  <p>Relying on Unicode control characters to establish direction for every block is not feasible because line breaks terminate the effect of such control characters. It also makes the data much less stable, and unnecessarily difficult to manage if control characters have to appear at every point where they would be needed.</p>
  <p class="advisement" id="bidi_block_auto"><a class="self" href="#bidi_block_auto">&#x200B;</a>It must be possible to also set the direction for content fragments to <code class="kw" translate="no">auto</code>.

  <p>A typical approach here would be to set the direction based on the first strong directional character outside of any markup, but this is not the only possible method. The algorithm used to determine directionality when direction is set to auto should match that expected by the receiver.</p>
  <p>The first-strong algorithm looks for the first character in the paragraph with a strong directional property according to the Unicode definitions. It then sets the base direction of the paragraph according to the direction of that character.</p>
  <p>Note that the first-strong algorithm may incorrectly&nbsp;guess the direction of the paragraph when the first character is not typical of the rest of the paragraph, such as when a RTL paragraph or line starts with a LTR brand name or technical term.</p>

  <p>Style sheets such as CSS may not always be used with the data, or carried with the data when it is syndicated, etc. Directional information is fundamentally important to correct display of the data, and should be associated more closely and more permanently with the markup or data.</p>

    <h3>Setting base direction for inline or substring text</h3>
<p>'Inline text' here has a readily understandable meaning in markup. It also applies to strings (eg. in JSON, CVS, or other plain text formats), meaning runs of characters which don't include all the characters in the string.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="bidi_inline_change"><a class="self" href="#bidi_inline_change">&#x200B;</a>It must be possible to indicate spans of inline text where the base direction changes. If markup is available, this is the preferred method. Otherwise your specification must require that Unicode control characters are recognized by the receiving application, and correctly implemented.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="bidi_inline_auto"><a class="self" href="#bidi_inline_auto">&#x200B;</a>It must be possible to also set the direction for a span to auto. This means that the base direction will be determined by examining the content itself. A typical approach here would be to set the direction based on the first strong directional character outside of any markup. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#bidi_inline_auto">more</a></p>
    <p>The first-strong algorithm looks for the first character in the paragraph with a strong directional property according to the Unicode definitions. It then sets the base direction of the paragraph according to the direction of that character.</p>
    <p>Note that the first-strong algorithm may incorrectly&nbsp;guess the direction of the paragraph when the first character is not typical of the rest of the paragraph, such as when a RTL paragraph or line starts with a LTR brand name or technical term.</p>
    <p>For additional information about algorithms for detecting direction, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-bidi/#auto-direction-algorithms">Estimation algorithms</a> in the document where this was discussed with reference to HTML.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="bidi_inline_rli"><a class="self" href="#bidi_inline_rli">&#x200B;</a>If users use Unicode bidirectional control characters, the isolating RLI/LRI/FSI with PDI characters must be supported by the application and recommended (rather than RLE/LRE with PDF) by the spec.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="bidi_inline_rlm"><a class="self" href="#bidi_inline_rlm">&#x200B;</a>Use of RLM/LRM should be appropriate, and expectations of what those controls can and cannot do should be clear in the spec. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#bidi_inline_rlm">more</a></p>
    <p>The Unicode bidirectional control characters <span class="uname">U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</span> and <span class="uname">U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK</span> are not sufficient on their own to manage bidirectional text. They cannot produce a different base direction for embedded text. For that you need to be able to indicate the start and end of the range of the embedded text.&nbsp; This is best done by markup, if available, or failing that using the other Unicode bidirectional controls mentioned just above.</p>
<p class="advisement" id="bidi_inline_dedicated_attr"><a class="self" href="#bidi_inline_dedicated_attr">&#x200B;</a>For markup, provide dedicated attributes for control of base direction and bidirectional overrides; do not rely on the user applying style properties to arbitrary markup to achieve bidi control.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="bidi_inline_all_elems"><a class="self" href="#bidi_inline_all_elems">&#x200B;</a>For markup, allow bidi attributes on all inline elements in markup that contain text.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="bidi_inline_embed"><a class="self" href="#bidi_inline_embed">&#x200B;</a>For markup, provide attributes that allow the user to (a) create an embedded base direction or (b) override the bidirectional algorithm altogether; the attribute should allow the user to set the direction to LTR or RTL or the aforementioned Auto in either of these two scenarios.</p>

<p>Another Character Model document is currently in development, entitled <a href="https://w3c.github.io/charmod-norm/">String Matching</a>. It looks at issues that arise when you try to compare two strings, be it identifiers or authored content.</p>

<hr/>

    <p>The term <em>character</em> is often used to mean different things in different contexts: it can variously refer to the visual, logical, or byte-level representation of a given piece of text. This makes the term too imprecise to use when specifying algorithms, protocols, or document formats. Understanding how characters are defined and encoded in computing systems, along with the associated terminology used to make such specification unambiguous, is thus a necessary prerequisite to discussing the processing of string data.</p>
    
    <p>The visual manifestation of a "character"&mdash;the shape most people mean when they say "character"&mdash;is what we call a <dfn>user-perceived character</dfn>. These visual building blocks are usually perceived to be a single unit of the visible text.</p>
    
    <p>At their simplest, user-perceived characters are a single shape that can be tied one-to-one to the underlying computing representation. But a user-perceived character can be formed, in some scripts, from more than one character. And a given logical character can take many different shapes due to such influences as font selection, style, or the surrounding context (such as adjacent characters). In some cases, a single user-perceived character might be formed from a long sequence of logical characters. And some logical characters (so-called "combining marks") are always used in conjunction with another character.</p>
    
    <p>When user-perceived characters are represented visibly (on screen or in print), they are represented by individual rendering units. This visual unit is called a <dfn>grapheme</dfn> (the word <dfn>glyph</dfn> is also used). Graphemes are the visual units found in fonts and rendering software.</p>
    
    <aside class=example>
		<h5>Examples of user-perceived characters</h5>
		<p>Here is the word for "Unicode" in the Latin, Katakana, Arabic, and Devanagari scripts.</p>
		<p class=bigtext>Unicode
		   <span lang=ja>&#x30E6;&#x30CB;&#x30B3;&#x30FC;&#x30C9;</span>
		   <span lang=ar dir=rtl>&#x064A;&#x0648;&#x0646;&#x064A;&#x0643;&#x0648;</span>
		   <span lang=hi>&#x092F;&#x0942;&#x0928;&#x093F;&#x0915;&#x094B;&#x0921;</span>
		</p>
		<p>The last example, in the Devanagari script (which is used to write Hindi, among other languages) is made up of four graphemes:</p>
		<p class=bigtext lang=hi>&#x092F;&#x0942;&nbsp;&#x0928;&#x093F;&nbsp;&#x0915;&#x094B;&nbsp;&#x0921;</p>
    </aside>
    
    <p>Graphemes are encoded into computer systems using "logical characters". A <dfn>character set</dfn> is a set of logical characters: a specific collection of characters that can be used together to encode text. The most important character set is the <dfn>Universal Character Set</dfn>, also known as [[Unicode]]. This character set includes all of the characters used to encode text, including historical or extinct writing systems as well as modern usage, private use, typesetting symbols, and other things, such as the emoji. Other character sets are defined subsets of Unicode. In Unicode, a 'character' is a single abstract logical unit of text. Each character in Unicode is assigned a unique integer number between <code>0x0000</code> and <code>0x10FFFF</code>, which is called its <dfn>code point</dfn>. The term code point therefore unambiguously refers to a single logical character and its integer representation.</p>

    <p class=advisement id="char_term_def"><a class="self" href="#char_term_def">&#x200B;</a>Specifications SHOULD explicitly define the term 'character' to mean a Unicode code point.</p>
    
    <p>The relationship between code points and graphemes can be complex. In most cases, a code point sequence that forms a single grapheme should be treated as a single textual unit. For example, when cursoring across text, an entire grapheme should select together. It shouldn't be possible to cursor into the "middle" of a grapheme or delete only a part of user-perceived character. Because the relationship is not one-to-one between code points and graphemes and because the relationship can be somewhat complex, [[Unicode]] defines a specific type of grapheme: the <dfn>extended grapheme cluster</dfn> which most closely matches the mapping of the underlying logical character sequence to a user-perceived character. When referring to 'graphemes' in this document, we mean extended grapheme clusters (unless otherwise called out).</p>
    
    <aside class=example>
		<h5>Hindi example showing mapping from graphemes to code points</h5>
		<p>Returning to the example above, the Hindi word for Unicode is made of four graphemes:</p>
		<p class=bigtext lang=hi>&#x092F;&#x0942;&nbsp;<span style="color:red">&#x0928;&#x093F;</span>&nbsp;&#x0915;&#x094B;&nbsp;&#x0921;</p>
		<p>Several of these graphemes are made up of more than one Unicode character because of the way that the Devanagari script works. In Devanagari, the basic set of "letters" are syllables ending with the short 'a' vowel sound. When you want to use a different vowel, you add a combining vowel character that changes the shape of the grapheme. The red text in the example above is the syllable "ni" in "Unicode". It is made of two characters: U+0928 (the syllable "na") and U+093F (combining "short i" sound):</p>
		
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td class=bigtext>&#x092f;</td>
				<td class=bigtext>&#x0942;</td>
				<td class=bigtext style="color:red">&#x0928;</td>
				<td class=bigtext style="color:red">&#x093f;</td>
				<td class=bigtext>&#x0915;</td>
				<td class=bigtext>&#x094b;</td>
				<td class=bigtext>&#x0921;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>U+092F</code></td>
				<td><code>U+0942</code></td>
				<td><code>U+0928</code></td>
				<td><code>U+093F</code></td>
				<td><code>U+0915</code></td>
				<td><code>U+094B</code></td>
				<td><code>U+0921</code></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
    </aside>

    <p>Another example of the complex relationship between code points and graphemes are certain emoji. The emoji character for "family" has a code point in Unicode: <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x1F46A;</span> [<span class="uname">U+1F46A FAMILY</span>]</span>. It can also be formed by using using a sequence of code points: <span class="uname">U+1F468 U+200D U+1F469 U+200D U+1F466</span>. Altering or adding other emoji characters can alter the composition of the family. For example the sequence <span class="uname" translate="no">&#x1f468;&#x200d;&#x1f469;&#x200d;&#x1f467;&#x200d;&#x1f467; U+1F468 U+200D U+1F469 U+200D U+1F467 U+200D U+1F467</span> results in a composed emoji character for a "family: man, woman, girl, girl" on systems that support this kind of composition. Many common emoji can <em>only</em> be formed using sequences of code points, but should be treated as a single user-perceived character when displaying or processing the text. You wouldn't want to put a line-break in the middle of the family!</p>    
    
    <p>Unicode code points are just abstract integer values: they are not the values actually present in the memory of the computer or serialized on the wire. When processing text, computers use an array of fixed-size integer units. One such common unit is the <dfn>byte</dfn> (or <em>octet</em>, since bytes have 8 bits per unit). There are also 16-bit, 32-bit, or other size units. In many programming languages, the unit is called a <code>char</code>, which suggests that strings are made of "characters". We use the term <dfn>code unit</dfn> to refer unambiguously to the programming and serialized representation of characters. For example, in C, a <code>char</code> is generally an 8-bit byte: each <code>char</code> is a 8-bit code unit. In Java or Javascript, a <code>char</code> is a 16-bit value.</p>
    
    <p>A set of rules for converting code points to or from code units is called a <dfn>character encoding form</dfn> (or just "character encoding" for short.</p>
    
    <aside class=example>
       <h2>UTF-8 Character Encoding Form</h2>
       
       <p>The most common character encoding used on the Web is UTF-8. UTF-8 uses 8-bit bytes as its code unit. Each Unicode code point encoded into UTF-8 takes between one and four bytes to encode. ASCII characters take one byte to encode. Code points from 0x80 to 0x7FF take two bytes. Code points from 0x800 to 0xFFFF take three bytes. And code points from 0x10000 to 0x10FFFF (that is, the rest of Unicode) take four bytes each.</p>

    <h3>Designing character escapes</h3>
    <p class="advisement" id="char_escaping"><a class="self" href="#char_escaping">&#x200B;</a>Specifications should provide a mechanism for escaping characters, particularly those which are invisible or ambiguous. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#char_heuristics">more</a></p>
      <p>It is generally recommended that character escapes be provided so that difficult to enter or edit sequences can be introduced using a plain text editor. Escape sequences are particularly useful for invisible or ambiguous Unicode characters, including zero-width spaces, soft-hyphens, various bidi controls, mongolian vowel separators, etc. </p>
      <p>For advice on use of escapes in markup, but which is mostly generalisable to other formats, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-escapes">Using character escapes in markup and CSS</a>.</p>

    <p class="advisement" id="char_esc_end"><a class="self" href="#char_esc_end">&#x200B;</a>Escape syntax SHOULD require either explicit end delimiters or a fixed number of characters in each character escape. Escape syntaxes where the end is determined by any character outside the set of characters admissible in the character escape itself SHOULD be avoided. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#C044">more</a></p>
    <p class="advisement" id="char_esc_hex"><a class="self" href="#char_esc_hex">&#x200B;</a>Whenever specifications define character escapes that allow the representation of characters using a number, the number MUST represent the Unicode code point of the character and SHOULD be in hexadecimal notation. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#C045">more</a></p>
    <p class="advisement" id="char_esc_acceptable"><a class="self" href="#char_esc_acceptable">&#x200B;</a>Escaped characters SHOULD be acceptable wherever their unescaped forms are; this does not preclude that syntax-significant characters, when escaped, lose their significance in the syntax.

   <h3>Truncating or limiting the length of strings</h3>
    
    <p>Some specifications, formats, or protocols or their implementations need to specify limits for the size of a given data structure or text field. This could be due to many reasons, such as limits on processing, memory, data structure size, and so forth. When selecting or specifying limits on the length of a given string, specifications or implementations need to ensure that they do not cause corruption in the text.</p>
    
    <p class="advisement" id="char_trunc_no_limit"><a class="self" href="#char_trunc_no_limit">&#x200B;</a>Specifications SHOULD NOT limit the size of data fields unless there is a specific practical or technical limitation.</p>
    
    <p>There are many reasons why a length limit might be needed in a specification or format. Generally length limits correspond to underlying limits in the implementation, such as the use of fixed-size fields in a database or data store, the desire to fit into practical boundaries such as packet size, or some other implementation detail related to storage allocation or efficiency.</p>
    
    <p>When truncating strings, it's necessary to decide what units to use when counting the size of the string. In many cases this is beyond the control of the specification, since the truncation is occuring for some preordained reason. However, when the choice is available, some general guidelines can be applied.</p>
    
    <p>If the limitation is related to the number of display positions, the grapheme count usually corresponds most closely to the expected limit. Note that proportional width fonts, combining marks, complex scripts, and many other factors complicate counting "screen positions". In Web pages, for example, the CSS <kbd>text-overflow</kbd> property provides visual truncation without disturbing the content of the text. Attempts to estimate the size of a given piece of text based on the number of Unicode code points or even the number of grapheme clusters is mostly futile.</p>
    
    <p>Otherwise most limits are expressed in terms of code points in Unicode or code units (such as bytes) in a specific character encoding. Code points provides the best user experience, since all Unicode code points are treated identically: if text is truncated after 40 code points, all languages and scripts get the same number of code points to work with. By contrast, when the size limit is expressed in code units such as bytes in UTF-8, users who write in a language that mostly uses ASCII letters get many more characters (code points) for a given size limit than user's whose language is mostly made up of characters that take 2-, 3-, or 4-bytes per code point.</p>
    
    <aside class=example>
		<h2>Text truncation in UTF-8</h2>
		<p>Below you can see the effect of truncating a given string of text encoded in UTF-8 on a 40-byte boundary. There are several things to notice here.</p>
		<p>First, the number of characters in the truncated string decreases as the number of bytes required per character goes up. So the Cyrillic string has half the number of characters as the ASCII string. The Chinese string has about 1/3 the number. And the emoji string has 1/4.</p>
		<p>Second, in two of the three examples, the text is truncated on a byte boundary in the middle of a character. The resulting "dangling byte" is rendered as U+FFFD and the byte sequence itself is not valid UTF-8. This can interfere with the validity of a given text file. Unlike many legacy character encodings, UTF-8 is highly patterned, so the the longest broken character sequence that can result from mid-character truncation is one character. By contrast, in many legacy encodings, a file or document containing a mid-character truncated string can be wholly changed or rendered unintelligible after that point.</p>

    <h3>Setting box positioning coordinates when text direction varies</h3>
    <p class="advisement" id="vertical_box_posn"><a class="self" href="#vertical_box_posn">&#x200B;</a>Box positioning coordinates must take into account whether the text is horizontal or vertical. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#vertical_box_posn">more</a></p>
    <p>It is typical, when localizing a user interface or web page, to create mirror-images for the RTL and LTR versions. For example, it is likely that a box that appears near the left side of a window containing English content would appear near the right side of the window if the content is Arabic or Hebrew. It should preferably automatic for this to change, based on the base direction of the current context, unless there is a strong reason for using absolute geometry. One way to achieve this is to use keywords such as <code class="kw" translate="no">start</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">end</code>, rather than <code class="kw" translate="no">left</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">right</code>, to indicate position.</p>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p class="advisement" id="type_line_height"><a class="self" href="#type_line_height">&#x200B;</a>Line heights must allow for characters that are taller than English.</p>
<p class="advisement" id="type_box_size"><a class="self" href="#type_box_size">&#x200B;</a>Box sizes must allow for text expansion in translation.</p>
<p class="advisement" id="type_linebreak"><a class="self" href="#type_linebreak">&#x200B;</a>Line wrapping should take into account the special rules needed for non-Latin scripts. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#type_linebreak">more</a></p>
<p>Various non-Latin writing systems don't simply wrap text on inter-word spaces. They have additional rules that must be respected. For example</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese, Japanese and Korean wrap after characters, but don't put certain characters at the start/end of a line.</li>
<li>Thai and other SE Asian scripts wrap at word boundaries, but words are not delimited by spaces – spaces are instead used to separate phrases.</li>
<li>Tibetan wraps after the tsek character that follows a syllable – words are not separated by spaces, and lines can break within a word.</li>
<li>Indic and other complex scripts break at orthographic syllable boundaries, which are often two or more grapheme clusters.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#line-breaking">CSS Text Level 3 specification</a> for additional background. (<a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/tutorial/part5">This tutorial</a> provides additional examples, if needed.)</p>
<p class="advisement" id="type_presentational_tags"><a class="self" href="#type_presentational_tags">&#x200B;</a>Avoid specifying presentational tags, such as <code class="kw" translate="no">b</code> for bold, and <code class="kw" translate="no">i</code> for italic. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#type_presentational_tags">more</a></p>
<p> It is best to avoid presentational markup <code class="kw" translate="no">b</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">i</code> or <code class="kw" translate="no">u</code>, since it isn't interoperable across writing systems and furthermore may cause unnecessary problems for localisation. In addition, some scripts have native approaches to things such as emphasis, that do not involve, and can be very different from, bolding, italicisation, etc.</p>
<p>In the HTML case, there was a legacy issue, but unless there is one for your specification, the recommendation is that styling be used instead to determine the presentation of the text, and that any markup or tagging should allow for general semantic approaches.</p>
