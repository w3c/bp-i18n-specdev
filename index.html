    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Developers of specifications need advice  to ensure that what they produce will work for communities around the globe.</p>
      <p>The Internationalization (i18n) WG tries to assist working groups  by reviewing specifications and engaging in discussion. Often, however, such interventions come later in the process than would be ideal, or mean that the i18n WG has to repeat the same information for each working group it interacts with.</p>
      <p>It would be better if specification developers could access a checklist of best practices, which points  to explanations, examples and rationales where developers need it. Developers would then be able to build this knowledge into their work from the earliest stages, and could thereby reduce  rework needed when the i18n WG reviews their specification.</p>
      <p>This document contains the beginnings of a checklist, and points to locations where you can find explanations, examples and rationales for recommendations&nbsp;made.&nbsp; If there is no such other place, that extra information will be added to this document. It is still early days for this document, and it may also be used to develop ideas and organize them.</p>
      <p>You may prefer to use <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/developing-specs?collapse">Internationalization Techniques: Developing specifications</a> most of the time, since it uses JavasScript to  help you more quickly see what's available and drill down to the information you need. (Where needed, it links to this or other documents.) There is also a <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/developing-specs">non-dynamic version</a> of the document available.</p>

  <p>Here we are talking about an independent unit of data. Examples include a whole HTML page, an XML document, a Json file, a WebVTT script, an annotation, etc.</p>
  
  <section id="sec_lang_decl" class="subtopic">
  <h3>Declaring language</h3>
  
  <p>Language information for a given resource can be used with two main objectives in mind: for text-processing, or as a statement of the intended use of the resource. We will explain the difference here.</p>
  
  <section id="sec_text_processing_lang">
    <h4>Text-processing language information</h4>
    <p>The <dfn>text-processing language</dfn> is the language that is relevant for processing the content when it comes to spell-checking, styling, voice production, etc. For such operations, only one language should be identified at a time for a given range of content.</p>
    <p>When specifying the language for text-processing purposes you are declaring the language in which <strong>a specific range of text is actually written</strong>, so that user agents or applications that manipulate the text, such as voice browsers, spell checkers, or style processors, etc., can apply the appropriate rules to the text in question. So we are, by necessity, talking about associating a <em>single</em> language with a <em>specific</em> range of text.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="tp_lang_values"><a class="self" href="#tp_lang_values">&#x200B;</a>A language declaration that indicates the text-processing language for a range of text must be associated with a single language  value. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_text_processing_lang">more</a></p>
    <p>It is normal to express a text-processing language as the default language for processing the resource as a whole, but it may also be necessary to indicate where the language changes within the resource.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_attribute_xml"><a class="self" href="#lang_attribute_xml">&#x200B;</a>Use the HTML <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> and XML <code class="kw" translate="no">xml:lang</code> language attributes where appropriate, rather than creating a new attribute or mechanism. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#lang_attribute_xml">more</a></p>
    <p>For example, XML provides <code class="kw" translate="no">xml:lang</code> which can be used in all XML formats to identify the text-processing language for a range of text. It's useful to continue using that, since authors recognise it, as do XML processors.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="sec_lang_meta">
    <h4>Language metadata about the resource as a whole</h4>
    <p>It may also be useful to describe the language of a resource <strong> as a whole</strong>. This type of language declaration typically indicates the <strong>intended use of the resource</strong>. For example, such metadata may be used for searching, serving the right language version, classification, etc. </p>
    <p>This type of language declaration differs from that of the text-processing declaration in that (a)  the value for such declarations may be more than one  language subtag, and (b) the language value declared doesn't indicate which bits of a multilingual resource are in which language.</p>
    <p>The language(s) describing the intended use of a resource do not necessarily include every language used in a document. For example, many documents on the Web contain embedded fragments of content in different languages, whereas the page is clearly aimed at speakers of one particular language. For example, a German city-guide for Beijing may contain useful phrases in Chinese, but it is aimed at a German-speaking audience, not a Chinese one.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, it is also possible to imagine a situation where a document contains the same or parallel content in more than one language. For example, a web page may welcome Canadian readers with French content in the left column, and the same content in English in the right-hand column. Here the document is equally targeted at speakers of both languages, so there are two audience languages. Another use case is a blog or a news page aimed at a multilingual community, where some articles on a page are in one language and some in another. In this case, it may make sense to list more than one  language tag as the value of the language declaration.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="metadata_lang_values"><a class="self" href="#metadata_lang_values">&#x200B;</a>A metadata-type language declaration that indicates the intended use of the resource, rather than the language of a specific range of text, may be associated with multiple language  values. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_lang_meta">more</a></p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="sec_lang_mixed">
    <h4>Declaring  language for the resource</h4>
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_whole_res"><a class="self" href="#lang_whole_res">&#x200B;</a>The specification should indicate how to define the default text-processing language for the resource as a whole. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#lang_whole_res">more</a></p>
    <p>It saves trouble to identify the language, or at least the default language, of the resource as a whole in one place. For example, in an HTML file, this is done by setting the <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> attribute on the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> element.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_inherit"><a class="self" href="#lang_inherit">&#x200B;</a>Content within the resource should inherit the language of the text-processing declared at the resource level, unless it is specifically overridden.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_tp_meta"><a class="self" href="#lang_tp_meta">&#x200B;</a>Consider whether it is necessary to have separate declarations to indicate the text-processing language versus metadata about the expected use of the resource. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#lang_tp_meta">more</a></p>
    <p>In many cases a resource contains  text in only one language, and in many more cases the language declared as the default language for text-processing is the same as the language that describes the metadata about the resource as a whole. In such cases it makes sense to have a single declaration.</p>
    <p>It becomes problematic, however, to use a single declaration when it refers to more than one language unless there is a way to determine which one language should be used as the text-processing default.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="lang_mixing"><a class="self" href="#lang_mixing">&#x200B;</a>If there is only one language declaration for a resource, and it has more than one language tag as a value, it must be possible to identify the default text-processing language for the resource. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#lang_tp_meta">more</a></p>

    <p>BCP 47 defines a method to combine subtags in order to create a much more powerful notation for language tags than that provided by the old ISO lists, but it is also backwards compatible with the ISO lists.</p>
    <p>For an overview of the key features of BCP 47, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/">Language tags in HTML and XML</a>.</p>

    <p>The link to and name of BCP 47 was created specifically so that there is an unchanging reference to the definition of Tags for the Identification of Languages. RFCs 3066, 4646 and 5646 are versions of BCP 47.</p>

    <h3>Setting the default base direction</h3>
    
    
      	<p>In order to correctly display text written in a 'right-to-left' script, it is important to know the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics#context" class="termref">base direction</a> that should be applied to that text. For more information see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>.</p>
        <aside class="example">
      	<p>For example, the following annotation will not display correctly unless the application doing the display knows that the base direction needs to be right-to-left.</p>
        <pre>{
  "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
  "id": "http://example.org/anno5",

    "language" : "he"
  },
  "target": "http://example.org/photo1"
}
</pre>
<p>You would expect this phrase to be displayed as</p>
<p><span dir="rtl">פעילות הבינאום, W3C</span></p>
<p>however, if there is no indication that the base direction should be right-to-left the following incorrect display will be produced:</p>
<p>פעילות הבינאום, W3C</p>

    <p class="advisement" id="bidi_res_default"><a class="self" href="#bidi_res_default">&#x200B;</a>The  default base direction, in the absence of other information, should be LTR. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#sec_bidi_resource">more</a></p>

    <h4>Base direction values</h4>
    <p class="advisement" id="bidi_values"><a class="self" href="#bidi_values">&#x200B;</a>Values for the default base direction should include left-to-right, right-to-left, and auto. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#bidi_values">more</a></p>
    <p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">auto</code> value allows automatic detection of the base direction for a piece of text. For example, the <code class="kw" translate="no">auto</code> value of <code class="kw" translate="no">dir</code> in HTML looks for the first strong directional character in the text, but ignores certain items of markup also, to guess the base direction of the text. Note that automatic detection algorithms are far from perfect. First-strong detection is unable to correctly identify text that is really right-to-left, but that begins with a strong LTR character. Algorithms that attempt to judge the base direction based on contents of the text are also problematic. The best scenario is one where the base direction is known and declared.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="bidi_lang"><a class="self" href="#bidi_lang">&#x200B;</a>Do not assume that direction can be determined from language information. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#bidi_lang">more</a></p>
    <p>The following are all reasons you cannot use language tags to provide information about base direction:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>you can't produce the <code class="kw" translate="no">auto</code> value with language tags.</li>
    <li>some languages are written with either RTL or LTR scripts.</li>
    <li>the only reliable part of the language tag that would indicate the base direction is the script tag, but BCP47 recommends that you suppress the use of the script tag for languages that don't usually need it, such as  Hebrew (suppressscript: Hebr). Languages, such as Persian, that are usually written in a RTL script may be written in transcribed form, and it's not possible to guarrantee that the necessary script tag would be present to carry the directional information. In summary, you won't be able to rely on people supplying script tags as part of the language information in order to influence direction.</li>
    <li>the incidence of use of language tags and base direction markers don't necessarily coincide.</li>
    <li>they are not semantically equivalent.</li>

    <h3>Designing character escapes</h3>
    <p class="advisement" id="char_escaping"><a class="self" href="#char_escaping">&#x200B;</a>Specifications should provide a mechanism for escaping characters, particularly those which are invisible or ambiguous. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#char_heuristics">more</a></p>
      <p>It is generally recommended that character escapes be provided so that difficult to enter or edit sequences can be introduced using a plain text editor. Escape sequences are particularly useful for invisible or ambiguous Unicode characters, including zero-width spaces, soft-hyphens, various bidi controls, mongolian vowel separators, etc. </p>
      <p>For advice on use of escapes in markup, but which is mostly generalisable to other formats, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-escapes">Using character escapes in markup and CSS</a>.</p>
    <p class="advisement" id="char_esc_new"><a class="self" href="#char_esc_new">&#x200B;</a>Specifications SHOULD NOT invent a new escaping mechanism if an appropriate one already exists. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#C042">more</a></p>
    <p class="advisement" id="char_esc_alternates"><a class="self" href="#char_esc_alternates">&#x200B;</a>The number of different ways to escape a character SHOULD be minimized (ideally to one). <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#C043">more</a></p>
    <p class="advisement" id="char_esc_end"><a class="self" href="#char_esc_end">&#x200B;</a>Escape syntax SHOULD require either explicit end delimiters or a fixed number of characters in each character escape. Escape syntaxes where the end is determined by any character outside the set of characters admissible in the character escape itself SHOULD be avoided. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#C044">more</a></p>
    <p class="advisement" id="char_esc_hex"><a class="self" href="#char_esc_hex">&#x200B;</a>Whenever specifications define character escapes that allow the representation of characters using a number, the number MUST represent the Unicode code point of the character and SHOULD be in hexadecimal notation. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#C045">more</a></p>
    <p class="advisement" id="char_esc_acceptable"><a class="self" href="#char_esc_acceptable">&#x200B;</a>Escaped characters SHOULD be acceptable wherever their unescaped forms are; this does not preclude that syntax-significant characters, when escaped, lose their significance in the syntax. In particular, if a character is acceptable in identifiers and comments, then its escaped form should also be acceptable. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#C046">more</a></p>

      <p>The U+XXXX format is well understood when referring to Unicode code points in a specification. These are space separated when appearing in a sequence. No additional decoration is needed. Note that a code point may contain four, five, or six hexadecimal digits. When fewer than four digits are needed, the code point number is zero filled. E.g. U+0020.</p>

    <h3>Setting box positioning coordinates when text direction varies</h3>
    <p class="advisement" id="vertical_box_posn"><a class="self" href="#vertical_box_posn">&#x200B;</a>Box positioning coordinates must take into account whether the text is horizontal or vertical. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#vertical_box_posn">more</a></p>
    <p>It is typical, when localizing a user interface or web page, to create mirror-images for the RTL and LTR versions. For example, it is likely that a box that appears near the left side of a window containing English content would appear near the right side of the window if the content is Arabic or Hebrew. It should preferably automatic for this to change, based on the base direction of the current context, unless there is a strong reason for using absolute geometry. One way to achieve this is to use keywords such as <code class="kw" translate="no">start</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">end</code>, rather than <code class="kw" translate="no">left</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">right</code>, to indicate position.</p>

<p>Various non-Latin writing systems don't simply wrap text on inter-word spaces. They have additional rules that must be respected. For example</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese, Japanese and Korean wrap after characters, but don't put certain characters at the start/end of a line.</li>
<li>Thai and other SE Asian scripts wrap at word boundaries, but words are not delimited by spaces – spaces are instead used to separate phrases.</li>
<li>Tibetan wraps after the tsek character that follows a syllable – words are not separated by spaces, and lines can break within a word.</li>
<li>Indic and other complex scripts break at orthographic syllable boundaries, which are often two or more grapheme clusters.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#line-breaking">CSS Text Level 3 specification</a> for additional background. (<a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/tutorial/part5">This tutorial</a> provides additional examples, if needed.)</p>
<p class="advisement" id="type_presentational_tags"><a class="self" href="#type_presentational_tags">&#x200B;</a>Avoid specifying presentational tags, such as <code class="kw" translate="no">b</code> for bold, and <code class="kw" translate="no">i</code> for italic. <a class="local" href="https://w3c.github.io/bp-i18n-specdev/#type_presentational_tags">more</a></p>
<p> It is best to avoid presentational markup <code class="kw" translate="no">b</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">i</code> or <code class="kw" translate="no">u</code>, since it isn't interoperable across writing systems and furthermore may cause unnecessary problems for localisation. In addition, some scripts have native approaches to things such as emphasis, that do not involve, and can be very different from, bolding, italicisation, etc.</p>
<p>In the HTML case, there was a legacy issue, but unless there is one for your specification, the recommendation is that styling be used instead to determine the presentation of the text, and that any markup or tagging should allow for general semantic approaches.</p>
<p>For an explanation of the issues surrounding <code class="kw" translate="no">b</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">i</code> tags, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-b-and-i-tags">Using &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; elements</a>.</p>
